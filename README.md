## How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Interpreting user needs begins with actively listening and understanding what users are trying to accomplish, even if they cannot always express it in technical terms. I try to focus on the problems they are experiencing and think about how software can offer practical solutions. This helps ensure that what I build is useful and relevant, not just functional.

Creating user stories gives structure to this process. They break down user goals into simple, clear statements that describe who the user is, what they need to do, and why. This format helps me focus on the end goal and provides a direct connection between what I am building and the value it brings to the user. It also makes collaboration easier by giving the whole team a shared understanding of the project’s purpose.

## How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

When I begin working on a program, I try to first understand the overall objective and then break the project into smaller, more manageable pieces. I find that this approach helps me stay organized and allows me to test and improve the software step by step, rather than waiting until everything is complete.

Looking ahead, I plan to fully integrate Agile practices into my workflow. I want to use sprint planning to set clear goals, daily stand-ups to stay on track, and retrospectives to learn from each development cycle. These practices not only improve productivity but also make it easier to adapt to feedback and changing requirements. Agile methods help keep the project focused while still allowing room for creativity and continuous improvement.

## What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member means being dependable, respectful, and open to collaboration. It involves more than just writing good code, it is about communicating clearly, offering support when needed, and contributing to a positive and inclusive team environment. 

I believe that strong teams are built on trust and mutual support. I do my best to listen actively, be open to new ideas, and contribute in ways that help the entire team move forward. Whether it is through helping solve a problem, sharing knowledge, or just being someone others can count on, I aim to be the kind of teammate who makes the group stronger.
